# Fitness Manager - About
Pro demo example of fitness managing app.

User can register or login (no email confirmation needed), add meals and workouts and put them into schedules separated by days.

Application is accessible on link: https://heroku-fitnessmanager.herokuapp.com

Additional information: After 30 min of inactivity application goes on sleep at Heroku VPS and to get it up running again you will have to wait twice at first request after application is put on sleep: first time -> on page request from a link, second time -> on sign up or login (while backend is getting up running too), then app will function normally.
